# prime_number_example
A bunch of examples of how to test prime numbers in different langugages, with explanation for beginners to learn. Currently only in Python, but will be adding C, Go and Rust examples shortly, maybe even more in the future
# Aim
The aim of this repository is not to use the code, like if you need to use this for your own projects I suggest you learn coding a LOT more, but for beginners to learn.
The explanation of the examples will be as comments inside the source files.
